### Bonus: Windows Live Family Safety | Free

Microsoft has included a built-in safety utility tool for maintaining your kids’ online safety in Windows 10\. First, you need to set up your account at Microsoft and then ensure your children have an outlook account as well. Now, once that is covered, you are now able to protect your children online using Windows Live Family Safety.

Windows Live Family Safety is an essential tool for the protection of your child from exposure to some of the false and gruesome ideas out there on the dark web that may even victimize your child.

![](https://malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Windows-Live-Family-Saftey.jpg)

For using Windows Live Family Safety, visit the Accounts Option in Settings. Click on Add a Family Member. Then, select Child Account. Just add your child’s outlook email id, and after completing, you can navigate to Manage Family Settings Online and make custom changes per child account.

Some of the things you can do include blocking inappropriate websites, setting screen time, viewing their recent activity, and getting weekly reports on your child’s online behavior.

## 5 Best Parental Control Software: Our Verdict

While Windows 10 has a built-in Parental control feature available, you might want something more powerful to protect your kids from Internet predators and other harmful content. My choice of Parental Control software has to be Qustodio. It has strong content filtering technology and monitoring tools. The panic button in the Qustodio is what attracts me. If the kid is in any danger he/she could press the panic button and we could reach out to them for help.

If you are looking for an affordable yet strong parental control tool then Kaspersky Safe Kids is the best option for you. If your kids mainly use iOS devices then you can also consider uKnowKids Premier.

However, I would like to mention that while parental control software will help you shield your children from the dark web and objectionable content, there is nothing better than a real conversation.

Sit your kids down and teach them the difference between right and wrong and share the consequences of wrong online choices with them to make them aware and smart individuals who will make wise decisions on their own.

Have a safe and protected Home Internet.​
