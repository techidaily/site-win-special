## What is Email Spoofing?

Email spoofing is the forging of emails to fool recipients. The aim is to make it appear that the email is from a source other than the actual origin. Spoofed emails often pretend that they are from reputable sources. You are more likely to open and read emails from trusted sources.

Hackers spoof emails by changing the data in the email header. They change the source email address and IP address. The email header is a piece of information that comes with each email. It contains information such as the FROM, TO, and DATE headers. It also includes the source’s IP address and subject.

Here’s an example:

## How are Emails Spoofed?

Surprisingly, it is easy to spoof emails. You need a Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) Server and mailing software. An SMTP server is a server that can send an email. Most web hosting plans offer an SMTP server. You can even install a local SMTP server on your computer.

Hackers then use ratware programs. A ratware program is a unique software that can change email header information. Hackers use this to send massive amounts of email to different recipients. Ratware programs make it easy to send thousands of malicious emails.

Cybercriminals get your email through different approaches. Some hack into databases such as the [Equifax breach](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/2017/09/equifax-data-breach-what-do). Others crawl the Internet, such as social media accounts, to gather email addresses. People often share their emails willingly. Hackers take advantage of this behavior.

Do not change information through the email unless you requested it. It is essential especially if you receive emails from your bank or credit card company.
