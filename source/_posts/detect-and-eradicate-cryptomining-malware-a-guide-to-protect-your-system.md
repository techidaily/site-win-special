## What is Crypto Miner Virus?

Crypto miner virus is a sneaky little malware that hijacks your computer’s resources to mine cryptocurrency without your consent or even your knowledge. This underhand tactic, known as cryptojacking, is driven by a simple motive: money. 

Cryptocurrency mining can be a gold mine, but it’s costly. For someone strapped for resources but not for shady morals, cryptojacking becomes a cheap and effective way of mining valuable coins.

## How does Cryptojacking Work?

Cryptomining is like an unwanted guest in your device, slowing it down and racking up your electricity bill in the process. It’s the key process behind generating new cryptocurrency – that digital currency you’ve heard so much about that’s created and encrypted on something called a blockchain.

Now, you might be wondering, “What’s a blockchain?” Well, it’s a record-keeping technology where transactions lead to complex mathematical puzzles. These puzzles must be solved for the transaction to go through. The people who solve these puzzles are cryptocurrency miners, and they’re rewarded with cryptocurrency for their efforts. The cryptomining process is the only way to create and encrypt new coins on the blockchain.

So, where does cryptojacking come in? Well, it uses your computer power to solve these complex mathematical operations needed to mine cryptocurrency. The results are then sent to the cryptojacker’s server.

Unlike other malware, cryptojacking isn’t usually about corrupting or stealing personal data. Its primary objective is to get its hands on your machine’s computing power. The longer the mining program runs, the more cryptocurrency the hackers can harvest. 

## Are You a Victim of Bitcoin Miner?

Wondering how you become a victim of cryptojacking? Hackers have more than one trick up their sleeves to enslave your computer. Here are two common methods:

### Web Browser-Based Attacks

This method involves a website or an online ad that delivers the cryptojacking malware to your computer. When you visit the website or click on the ad, the malware is automatically downloaded and installed on your computer. This type of attack is often referred to as “drive-by cryptojacking” because your computer is compromised just by visiting a website.

### Host-Based Attacks

This approach involves installing the cryptojacking malware directly on your computer. It can be done in a variety of ways, like sending you a malicious email attachment, using a fake app or game that contains the malware, or compromising the supply chain of a legitimate software provider to insert the malware into the software.

### Meet the Cryptojackers’ Favorite: Monero

Of all the cryptocurrencies, Monero (XMR) seems to have a special place in the hearts of cryptojackers. This digital currency is their top choice for malicious mining. 

### From Ransomware to Cryptojacking: The AstraLocker Story

AstraLocker, once a prominent ransomware operator, decided to hang up its ransomware boots to join the cryptojacking game. While ransomware can generate big bucks, not every attack results in a payout. Miners? They just infect, sit back, and enjoy a steady stream of profit.

## Cryptojacking in Action: Real-Life Examples

### 1\. The Coinhive Saga

Coinhive started with a noble intention. They allowed website owners to add a JavaScript code that would use visitor’s computer power to mine Monero, creating an advertising-free revenue stream. But, alas, it was too tempting for attackers who turned it into a cryptojacking tool. The party ended in March 2019 when Coinhive shut down due to declining user interest and increased regulatory scrutiny.

Post-Coinhive, cryptojacking attacks have evolved to be more covert and sophisticated, targeting APIs, open-source code, and even cloud infrastructures, according to ENISA.

### 2\. The FaceXWorm Scare

Remember the old “click this YouTube link” trick? FaceXWorm used this bait to lure unsuspecting Facebook Messenger users. Users ended up on a fake site, downloaded a Chrome extension to view content, and voila— their Facebook account got hijacked, unleashing the FaceXWorm malware that started mining cryptocurrency.

### 3\. The Black-T Menace

Last but not least, there’s Black-T, a cryptojacking malware variant by TeamTNT. They had a special appetite for AWS (Amazon Web Services) credentials on compromised systems and mined Monero. Their favorite hunting grounds? APIs with exposed Docker daemons and vulnerable systems ripe for cryptojacking attacks.
