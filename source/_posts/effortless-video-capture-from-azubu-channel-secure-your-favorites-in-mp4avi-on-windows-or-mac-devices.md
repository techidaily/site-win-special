## Effortless Video Capture From Azubu Channel: Secure Your Favorites in MP4/AVI on Windows or Mac Devices

### Overview

* _I would like to download Azubu videos of my favorite legends player, but I can not figure out how to make it. I do not expect to hook up bandicam and literally wait for it to record the whole video to record._
* _Whenever I open Azubu it lags and I can hardly ever catch a good view unless I am watching for a while. It is very annoying. Why and how to solve it?_

These are two examples I collected from Google forums, believe me, there are more like these. The point is I can offer solution to these two issues and more like these.
