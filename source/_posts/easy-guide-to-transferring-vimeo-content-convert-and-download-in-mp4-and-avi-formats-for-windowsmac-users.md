### Conclusion

Vimeo is a podcast website with high-definition videos. Different from most other similar video-sharing websites, Vimeo can transcode videos above 1280\*720 resolution people upload into two files: one is common quality file and the other is high-definition file and allow people to free download video source files. Vimeo supports many file formats including asf, asx, avi, divx, dv, dvx, m4v, mov, mp4, mpeg, mpg, qt, wmv, 3g2, 3gp, 3ivx and3v. Most importantly the videos you download from Vimeo are not as marked with Vimeo logo as YouTube.

With so many advantages Vimeo is boon for many video enthusiasts but when people actually download videos from Vimeo, there comes to a problem that the videos can not be downloaded either due to no "Download" button or some forbidden IP address. In this case you may need a Vimeo downloader to help you download videos from Vimeo. Among many Vimeo downloaders **I highly recommend Allavsoft which can batch download Videos from Vimeo to MP4, MOV, AVI, WMV, MPG, MKV, 3GP, MPG, Apple ProRes, MP3, WAV, FLAC etc. Allavsoft not only supports to download videos from Vimeo but also more other websites, like YouTube, Dailymotion, Metacafe, Redtube, Smotri and Vevo**.
