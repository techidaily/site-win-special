There are a number of different types of Android malware, but the most common ones that you need to be aware of include spyware, ransomware, remote access Trojans (RATs), and adware. [Spyware](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/) is designed to secretly collect private information from your phone without your knowledge. Ransomware holds your files hostage until you pay the ransom, while RATs enable criminals to remotely control your phone.

## What are the Indications of Virus Infection in Android?

Most people don’t realize that their phone is infected with a virus until it’s too late. Some of the most common symptoms of a virus infection on an Android phone include:

* **Slow Performance**: If your phone suddenly starts to run slowly or lag, this could be a sign that it has been infected with a virus.
* **Frequent Crashes and Freezes**: If your phone keeps freezing up or randomly crashing, this could be another indication of a virus infection.
* **Unusual Behavior**: You may notice that your phone is behaving in strange and unexpected ways. It may start to send text messages or make calls without your permission, it may install unfamiliar apps automatically, or it may change the look and feel of your phone’s user interface.
* **Battery Draining**: If your phone’s battery is draining quickly without reason, this could be a sign that it has been infected with a virus.

## How Can You Remove a Virus from an Android Phone Manually?

**_Note_**_: Steps can be different for different phone manufacturers. Look for similar steps on your phone._

1. On your phone press and hold the power button then on your screen touch and hold the power icon. This process would reboot your Android smartphone in **Safe Mode**.

4. Remember to make a list of apps that you are removing, so that if they are safe, you can reinstall them later
5. After each removal, restart your device in normal mode and see if the problem is fixed or not. Until the malicious apps are caught, repeat the above step.
6. Once the malicious application is found, you can reinstall the other applications that you have removed.

## Tips to Safeguard Devices from Malware

Protecting your device from malware is better than curing it after the infection. We have listed out the top tips that would help you to over keep a distance from malware. The tips would protect you from other malware programs too.

* Keep installed a robust security solution on your Android phone.
* Ensure that all your apps and the OS are updated with the latest version. An outdated app and OS carries loose ends and is vulnerable to malware attacks.
* Never click on any suspicious links from unknown emails and text messages.
* Avoid app downloads and installations from unknown sources. Only use the Google Play Store or other trusted sources. If you require an app outside of trusted sources, then scan it thoroughly before installation, and verify that it is secure.
* Avoid torrents and free download sites.
* Never use unprotected, opened public WiFi. If it is urgent, use a VPN along with that.
