This menu entry had been disappeared in EME 5.x,6.x .  
 It will be still need to save Windows and DOS batch files in codepage  
 Central Europen (DOS) (852,ibm852)  
 Text outputs of batch files must be stored in this code page for proper output of text. Specifications of files,directory names too.  
 There is need again add (852,ibm852) into menu of saved as (encoding) because CP852 is used in many european countries.  
 Now it appears only in menu open (encoding), not in menu save as (encoding).

You can add Save As (encoding) to the main menu by selecting **Customize Menus** on the **Tools** menu, and then select **File** category – **List of Encodings to Save**.

I opened only properties of desired defined encoding from defined encodings and pressed button OK. Desired entry is appearing in drop down encoding menu of save as command now.  
 Problem was solved, now it is OK.
