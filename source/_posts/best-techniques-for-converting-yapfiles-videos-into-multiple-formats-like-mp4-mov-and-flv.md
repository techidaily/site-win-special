## Best Techniques for Converting YAPfiles Videos Into Multiple Formats Like MP4, MOV & FLV

### Overview

Yapfiles is a free service allowing users to upload, store and watch the short videos with multiple file subjects, like games, animals, cartoons, nature, travel, etc. Have watched some excellent videos from Yapfiles and want to download them for offline purpose but do not know how to make that? If so, you come to the right place. The following article just introduces two methods to successfully and easily download your needed Yapfiles videos. Let's check them one by one.

### Method One: Click the Download file button

If you want to download one Yapfiles video, just open it and under the video playing interface, you will find a Download file button, click it and then the Yapfiles video will be opened in another new window. On this newly opened Yapfiles video interface, you will find a Download arrow button, click it and the Yapfiles video will be downloaded as an MP4.

Users can get an MP4 through this method, but this method can only get an MP4, but not other formats to you. What is worse is that this method can only help to download Yapfiles videos up to 50 MB. Worse still, this method can only download one Yapfiles video at one time, not downloading more than one Yapfiles video at one time. Want to avoid all the above limitations? The following Method Two can completely serve you.
