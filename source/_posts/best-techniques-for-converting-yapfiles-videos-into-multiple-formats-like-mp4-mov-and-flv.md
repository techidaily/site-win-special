### Method One: Click the Download file button

If you want to download one Yapfiles video, just open it and under the video playing interface, you will find a Download file button, click it and then the Yapfiles video will be opened in another new window. On this newly opened Yapfiles video interface, you will find a Download arrow button, click it and the Yapfiles video will be downloaded as an MP4.

Users can get an MP4 through this method, but this method can only get an MP4, but not other formats to you. What is worse is that this method can only help to download Yapfiles videos up to 50 MB. Worse still, this method can only download one Yapfiles video at one time, not downloading more than one Yapfiles video at one time. Want to avoid all the above limitations? The following Method Two can completely serve you.
